    *   In Android development, “Context” is a fundamental concept that represents the current
    *   state of your application and provides access to global information about the application environment.
    *   It’s like a handle to the system; it provides services like resolving resources, obtaining access to databases and preferences, and so on.
    *   In the context of adding location to your app, Context is used to interact with location services and to check permissions.

    *   in different ways—by looking at the stars, reading maps, or asking locals. The
    *   FusedLocationProviderClient is like that friend. It combines various data sources to provide the best
    *   location information in an efficient way. It’s a part of Google Play services and provides a simple API for
    *   getting location information.
    *
    *  ----| getFusedLocationProviderClient(context) `
    *
    *   This is like saying, “Hey, I need to use your location-finding
    *   skills.” By calling this function and giving it the context, you create an instance of
    *   FusedLocationProviderClient that you can use to start asking for location updates.

    *   A Geocoder is a class in Android that performs geocoding and reverse geocoding.
    *   Geocoding is the process of transforming a street address or other description of

    *   converts geographic coordinates into a human-readable address.

    *   Geocoder uses a backend service that it communicates with to perform its translations. Here’s how you can use it:
    *       1. Geocoding: You have an address or place name, and you want to find its coordinates.
    *       2. Reverse Geocoding: You have the latitude and longitude, and you need to find out the address.
